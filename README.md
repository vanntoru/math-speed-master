# Math Speed

Math Speed is a small Tkinter application that drills students on the complements of ten.  The
program displays simple flash cards and records reaction times so that repeated practice becomes
visible progress.

## Installation

1. Ensure **Python 3.10** or newer is installed.
2. No thirdâ€‘party packages are required, but an empty `requirements.txt` is
   provided for convenience:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # optional, installs nothing
   ```

## Quick Start

After installing the dependencies you can launch the GUI with:

```bash
python -m src.app.gui
```

This opens the training window and starts a session where you can practice ten-complement
calculations at speed.
